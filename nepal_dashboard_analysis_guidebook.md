## Panel-by-Panel Analysis Guide

### 1. Demographics Panel

**What it shows**: Population distribution by age, gender, education, employment

**Python Code Example**:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('Nepal-Grid view.csv')

# Count respondents by ward
ward_counts = df['Please choose the ward and village you live in'].value_counts()
print(ward_counts)

# Age distribution
age_counts = df['(62) What is your current age?'].value_counts()
print(age_counts)
```

**AI Prompt for Analysis**:
```
"I have survey data with age groups in column 62. Please help me:
1. Count how many people are in each age group
2. Calculate percentages
3. Identify which age groups are most represented
Here's the data: [paste sample data]"
```

### 2. Life Satisfaction Panel

**What it measures**: Overall wellbeing using questions 1-5

**Calculation Method**:
```python
# Calculate life satisfaction score
life_questions = ['(1) Score', '(2) Score', '(3) Score', '(4) Score', '(5) Score']
df['Life_Satisfaction'] = df[life_questions].mean(axis=1)

# Get average by ward
ward_satisfaction = df.groupby('ward')['Life_Satisfaction'].mean()
```

**AI Prompt**:
```
"Help me calculate the average life satisfaction score from these 5 questions:
- Question 1: Life ladder (0-10 scale)
- Question 2: Overall satisfaction
- Question 3: Worthwhile activities
- Question 4: Happiness yesterday
- Question 5: Anxiety yesterday (reverse scored)
Show me how to get both individual and ward-level averages."
```

### 3. Economy Panel

**Key Questions**: 41-44 about financial stress, living paycheck to paycheck, food security

**Analysis Code**:
```python
# Economy domain calculation
economy_questions = ['(41) Score', '(42) Score', '(43) Score', '(44) Score']

# Reverse scoring for negative questions
df['(41) Score_reversed'] = 100 - df['(41) Score']  # Financial stress
df['(42) Score_reversed'] = 100 - df['(42) Score']  # Paycheck to paycheck

# Calculate domain score
df['Economy_Score'] = (df['(41) Score_reversed'] + 
                       df['(42) Score_reversed'] + 
                       df['(43) Score_reversed'] + 
                       df['(44) Score']) / 4
```

### 4. Tourism Impact Panel

**Questions**: 51-56 about tourism satisfaction and impacts

**Creating Tourism Analysis**:
```python
# Tourism support by ward
tourism_increase = df[df['(52) Overall, the number of tourists to my site should:'] == 'Increase  - बढोस्']
support_by_ward = tourism_increase.groupby('ward').size() / df.groupby('ward').size() * 100
```

---

## Open-Ended Questions Analysis

### Understanding Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis determines if text responses are positive, negative, or neutral about a topic.

### Key Open-Ended Questions:
1. **Q57**: Comments about tourism
2. **Q58**: Greatest threats to community
3. **Q59**: What you love about where you live
4. **Q77**: What makes you happy (one word)

### Step-by-Step Sentiment Analysis Process

#### Step 1: Extract Open-Ended Responses
```python
# Get all tourism comments
tourism_comments = df['(57SA) Would you like to make any comments about tourism in your site?'].dropna()

# Save to text file for analysis
with open('tourism_comments.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    for comment in tourism_comments:
        f.write(comment + '\n\n')
```

#### Step 2: Prepare AI Prompt for Claude/ChatGPT

**Example Prompt for Tourism Sentiment**:
```
"I have tourism feedback from a Nepal mountain community. Please analyze these comments and provide:

1. Overall sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
2. Main themes mentioned
3. Specific concerns or praise
4. Recommendations based on feedback

Here are the comments:
[Paste your comments here]

Please format as:
- Sentiment: [Positive/Negative/Neutral]
- Key Themes: [List main topics]
- Positive Aspects: [What people like]
- Concerns: [What people worry about]
- Summary: [Brief overview]"
```

#### Step 3: Human-AI Interaction Example

**Human**: 
"Here are tourism comments from Ward 1. Please analyze the sentiment:
1. 'We need quality tourism all year, not just seasonal'
2. 'Too many helicopters disturbing peace'
3. 'Tourism brings jobs but damages culture'"

**AI Response**:
```
Sentiment Analysis Results:

Overall Sentiment: Mixed (60% negative, 40% positive)

Key Themes:
- Tourism seasonality concerns
- Helicopter noise pollution  
- Economic benefits vs cultural preservation

Positive Aspects:
- Job creation acknowledged
- Economic opportunities recognized

Concerns:
- Over-tourism in peak season
- Environmental disruption (helicopter noise)
- Cultural erosion fears

Recommendations:
1. Develop year-round tourism strategies
2. Implement helicopter flight restrictions
3. Create cultural preservation programs
```

### Analyzing "Greatest Threats" (Q58)

**Data Extraction**:
```python
threats = df['(58) What do you feel is the greatest threat to community wellbeing in the KPLRM:'].value_counts()
print(threats)
```

**AI Categorization Prompt**:
```
"Please categorize these community threats into themes:
1. Climate change - 45 responses
2. Outmigration of Sherpas - 23 responses  
3. Growing non-Sherpa land ownership - 15 responses
4. Helicopter noise - 12 responses

Create a summary with:
- Main threat categories
- Percentage breakdown
- Interconnections between threats"
```

## Chart Generation Guide

### Creating Visualizations with AI Help

#### 1. Bar Charts for Ward Comparison

**AI Prompt**:
```
"Help me create a Python bar chart showing:
- X-axis: Ward 1, Ward 2, Ward 3, Ward 4, Ward 5
- Y-axis: Average satisfaction score (0-100%)
- Title: 'Life Satisfaction by Ward'
- Colors: Use blue gradient
Include code to save as image."
```

**Generated Code**:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample data
wards = ['Ward 1', 'Ward 2', 'Ward 3', 'Ward 4', 'Ward 5']
scores = [72, 68, 70, 65, 69]

# Create bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
bars = plt.bar(wards, scores, color=['#1a4d94', '#2a5298', '#3a629c', '#4a72a0', '#5a82a4'])

# Customize
plt.ylim(0, 100)
plt.ylabel('Satisfaction Score (%)')
plt.title('Life Satisfaction by Ward', fontsize=16, pad=20)

# Add value labels
for bar in bars:
    height = bar.get_height()
    plt.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2., height + 1,
             f'{height}%', ha='center', va='bottom')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('ward_satisfaction.png', dpi=300)
plt.show()
```

#### 2. Pie Charts for Demographics

**AI Prompt**:
```
"Create a pie chart showing education levels:
- High School: 35%
- Some College: 25%
- Graduate Degree: 20%
- Other: 20%
Make it colorful with labels and percentages."
```

## AI Tools Usage Guide

### Best Practices for Claude Code

1. **Be Specific**: Include column names and sample data
2. **Ask for Explanations**: Request comments in code
3. **Iterate**: Start simple, then add complexity
4. **Verify Results**: Always check calculations

### Example Claude Code Session

**Human**: "I need to calculate the average score for questions 11-14 about health. Here's my data structure:
- (11) Score: 0-100%
- (12) Score: 0-100%  
- (13) Score: 0-100%
- (14) Score: 0-100%
Show me how to calculate individual and ward averages."

**Claude Code**: 
```python
import pandas as pd

# Read your data
df = pd.read_csv('Nepal-Grid view.csv')

# Define health columns
health_columns = ['(11) Score', '(12) Score', '(13) Score', '(14) Score']

# Calculate individual health scores
df['Health_Average'] = df[health_columns].mean(axis=1)

# Calculate ward averages
ward_health = df.groupby('ward')['Health_Average'].agg(['mean', 'count'])
ward_health.columns = ['Average_Score', 'Number_of_Respondents']

print("Health Scores by Ward:")
print(ward_health)

# Find wards with concerning health scores (below 60%)
low_health_wards = ward_health[ward_health['Average_Score'] < 60]
print("\nWards needing health interventions:")
print(low_health_wards)
```

### Using ChatGPT for Analysis

**Structured Prompt Template**:
```
Role: You are a data analyst helping analyze community survey data.

Task: [Specific analysis needed]

Data: [Paste relevant data]

Output Format:
1. Summary statistics
2. Key findings  
3. Visualizations needed
4. Recommendations

Constraints: Explain in simple terms for non-technical users.
```

## Complete Examples

### Example 1: Analyzing Tourism Paradox

**The Challenge**: Residents want more tourism (98% support) but worry about cultural impacts (75% concern)

**Analysis Process**:

1. **Extract Relevant Data**:
```python
# Tourism support
tourism_support = df['(52) Score'].mean()
print(f"Tourism increase support: {tourism_support}%")

# Cultural concern proxy (Q55 - tourism promotes culture)
cultural_promotion = df['(55) Score'].mean()
print(f"Believe tourism promotes culture: {cultural_promotion}%")
```

2. **Cross-Analysis by Ward**:
```python
# Create paradox analysis
paradox_data = df.groupby('ward').agg({
    '(52) Score': 'mean',  # Want more tourism
    '(55) Score': 'mean'   # Tourism promotes culture
})
paradox_data['Gap'] = paradox_data['(52) Score'] - paradox_data['(55) Score']
```

3. **AI Interpretation Prompt**:
```
"Help me understand this tourism paradox:
- 98% want more tourists
- Only 50% think tourism promotes local culture
- Financial challenges affect 70% of residents

What explains this contradiction? Provide insights."
```

### Example 2: Creating Domain Score Dashboard

**Goal**: Calculate scores for all 9 wellbeing domains

**Complete Python Script**:
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('Nepal-Grid view.csv')

# Define domain calculations
domains = {
    'Life Satisfaction': ['(1) Score', '(2) Score', '(3) Score', '(4) Score', '(5) Score'],
    'Psychological Wellbeing': ['(6) Score', '(7) Score', '(8) Score', '(9) Score', '(10) Score'],
    'Health': ['(11) Score', '(12) Score', '(13) Score', '(14) Score'],
    'Time Balance': ['(15) Score', '(16) Score', '(17) Score'],
    'Community': ['(18) Score', '(19) Score', '(20) Score', '(21) Score', '(22) Score', '(23) Score', '(24) Score'],
    'Social Support': ['(25) Score', '(26) Score', '(27) Score', '(28) Score'],
    'Environment': ['(33) Score', '(34) Score', '(35) Score', '(36) Score'],
    'Government': ['(37) Score', '(38) Score', '(39) Score', '(40) Score'],
    'Tourism': ['(51) Score', '(52) Score', '(53) Score', '(54) Score', '(55) Score', '(56) Score']
}

# Calculate domain scores
domain_scores = {}
for domain, questions in domains.items():
    domain_scores[domain] = df[questions].mean(axis=1).mean()

# Create visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
domains_list = list(domain_scores.keys())
scores_list = list(domain_scores.values())

bars = plt.barh(domains_list, scores_list)

# Color bars based on score
for i, bar in enumerate(bars):
    if scores_list[i] < 50:
        bar.set_color('#e74c3c')  # Red for low scores
    elif scores_list[i] < 70:
        bar.set_color('#f39c12')  # Orange for medium
    else:
        bar.set_color('#27ae60')  # Green for good

plt.xlabel('Score (%)')
plt.title('Community Wellbeing by Domain')
plt.xlim(0, 100)

# Add score labels
for i, v in enumerate(scores_list):
    plt.text(v + 1, i, f'{v:.1f}%', va='center')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('domain_scores.png', dpi=300)
plt.show()
```

### Example 3: Real Tourism Comments Analysis

**Actual Comments from the Data**:

From the Nepal survey, here are real tourism comments and how to analyze them:

**Raw Comments**:
1. "We want quality tourism - tourism all year around, not just seasonal." (Ward 2)
2. "पर्यटनको बिकासको लागी आवश्यक infrastructure ko वृद्धि गर्नु पर्छ।" (Need infrastructure development for tourism) (Ward 2)
3. "पर्यटनले खर्च गर्ने शिलसिला बिगतमा भन्दा धेरै घटेको छ। जस्तै Lukla मा हामी सानो छँदा प्राय Trek Last day भब्य हुने गर्दथ्यो।" (Tourist spending has decreased compared to the past) (Ward 2)
4. "Is good but need to make better" (Ward 2)

**AI Analysis Process**:

**Step 1 - Prepare the prompt**:
```
"Analyze these tourism comments from a Nepal mountain community:

1. 'We want quality tourism - tourism all year around, not just seasonal.'
2. 'Need infrastructure development for tourism' (translated from Nepali)
3. 'Tourist spending has decreased compared to the past. For example, in Lukla when we were young, trek last days used to be grand.' (translated)
4. 'Is good but need to make better'

Please provide:
1. Overall sentiment analysis
2. Key themes and concerns
3. Specific recommendations
4. Ward-specific insights"
```

**AI Response Example**:
```
Tourism Sentiment Analysis - Nepal Mountain Community

Overall Sentiment: Mixed to Negative (40% positive, 60% concerns)

Key Themes Identified:
1. **Seasonality Issues** - Desire for year-round tourism vs current seasonal peaks
2. **Infrastructure Gaps** - Need for better tourism infrastructure
3. **Economic Decline** - Tourist spending has decreased over time
4. **Quality vs Quantity** - Preference for "quality tourism"

Specific Concerns:
- Tourism is too concentrated in peak seasons
- Inadequate infrastructure to support tourism growth
- Nostalgic comparison showing tourism quality has declined
- Less economic benefit reaching local communities

Recommendations Based on Feedback:
1. Develop off-season tourism products (cultural tours, workshops)
2. Infrastructure investment plan focusing on basic amenities
3. Create premium tourism experiences to increase per-tourist revenue
4. Establish local business support programs

Ward-Specific Pattern:
All comments from Ward 2 (Lukla area) suggest this gateway community
feels the economic pressures most acutely, being the entry point
where changes in tourist behavior are most visible.
```

### Example 4: Analyzing "What Makes You Happy" Responses

**Real One-Word Responses from Q77**:
- "Dancing"
- "कामले" (Work)
- "family environment"
- "Working in airport and in shop"

**Creating Word Cloud Analysis**:

```python
from collections import Counter
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from wordcloud import WordCloud

# Extract happiness words
happiness_words = df['(77SA) In one word, what makes you happy?'].dropna()

# Count frequency
word_counts = Counter(happiness_words)

# Create word cloud
wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, 
                      background_color='white').generate_from_frequencies(word_counts)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('What Makes People Happy - Word Cloud')
plt.savefig('happiness_wordcloud.png')
```

**AI Categorization Prompt**:
```
"Categorize these happiness responses into themes:
- Dancing, family environment, work, working in airport and in shop

Group into categories like:
1. Family/Relationships
2. Work/Career
3. Activities/Hobbies
4. Economic Security"
```

## Data Validation: Ensuring Accuracy

After AI completes data analysis, it's crucial to validate the results. Here's how to verify accuracy using both AI tools and manual methods.

### Why Validation Matters
- AI can make calculation errors
- Data might have inconsistencies
- Formulas might be incorrectly applied
- Sample bias could affect results

### AI-Powered Validation Methods

#### 1. Cross-Validation with Different AI Tools

**Strategy**: Use multiple AI tools to verify the same calculation

**Example Process**:
```
Step 1 - Claude Code calculates domain scores
Step 2 - Ask ChatGPT to verify using the same data
Step 3 - Compare results
```

**Validation Prompt Template**:
```
"I have calculated the average satisfaction score for Ward 1 as 72.5%.
Here's my calculation method:
- Questions used: Q1-Q5
- Formula: (Sum of all scores) / (Number of responses)
- Sample data: [paste 5-10 rows]

Please verify this calculation and show your work step by step."
```

#### 2. Statistical Validation Checks

**Python Code for Automatic Validation**:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def validate_data_analysis(df, domain_name, question_columns, expected_range=(0, 100)):
    """
    Comprehensive validation function for survey analysis
    """
    validation_results = {}
    
    # 1. Check for missing values
    missing_count = df[question_columns].isnull().sum().sum()
    validation_results['missing_values'] = missing_count
    
    # 2. Verify score ranges
    for col in question_columns:
        min_val = df[col].min()
        max_val = df[col].max()
        if min_val < expected_range[0] or max_val > expected_range[1]:
            validation_results[f'{col}_range_error'] = f"Values outside expected range: {min_val}-{max_val}"
    
    # 3. Calculate domain score with verification
    domain_scores = df[question_columns].mean(axis=1)
    validation_results['mean_score'] = domain_scores.mean()
    validation_results['median_score'] = domain_scores.median()
    validation_results['std_deviation'] = domain_scores.std()
    
    # 4. Detect outliers
    Q1 = domain_scores.quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = domain_scores.quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    outliers = domain_scores[(domain_scores < Q1 - 1.5*IQR) | (domain_scores > Q3 + 1.5*IQR)]
    validation_results['outlier_count'] = len(outliers)
    
    # 5. Sample size check
    validation_results['sample_size'] = len(df)
    validation_results['responses_per_question'] = df[question_columns].count()
    
    return validation_results

# Example usage
validation = validate_data_analysis(df, 'Life Satisfaction', 
                                  ['(1) Score', '(2) Score', '(3) Score', '(4) Score', '(5) Score'])
print(validation)
```

#### 3. AI Double-Check Prompts

**For Sentiment Analysis Validation**:
```
"I analyzed 50 tourism comments and found:
- 60% positive
- 30% negative  
- 10% neutral

Here are 10 random samples:
[paste samples]

Please verify if my sentiment classification is accurate and explain any disagreements."
```

**For Statistical Calculations**:
```
"Verify these ward-level calculations:
Ward 1: 72% average (n=45)
Ward 2: 68% average (n=52)
Ward 3: 70% average (n=38)

The overall average is 70%. Is this mathematically correct considering the different sample sizes?"
```

### Manual Validation Methods

#### 1. Spot-Check Strategy

**For Large Datasets** - Check 5-10% randomly:
```python
# Random sampling for manual verification
def create_validation_sample(df, sample_percent=5):
    """
    Creates a random sample for manual checking
    """
    sample_size = int(len(df) * sample_percent / 100)
    sample = df.sample(n=sample_size, random_state=42)
    
    # Save to Excel for easy manual review
    with pd.ExcelWriter('validation_sample.xlsx') as writer:
        sample.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Sample Data')
        
        # Add calculation columns for manual checking
        sample['Manual_Check_Column'] = ''
        sample['Notes'] = ''
        sample.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Manual Validation')
    
    return sample
```

#### 2. Boundary Testing

Check extreme cases:
- Highest scores (should they be 100%?)
- Lowest scores (should they be 0%?)
- Missing data handling

**Quick Check List**:
```python
# Boundary validation
print("=== Boundary Check ===")
print(f"Minimum values found: {df[score_columns].min().min()}")
print(f"Maximum values found: {df[score_columns].max().max()}")
print(f"Any scores > 100%?: {(df[score_columns] > 100).any().any()}")
print(f"Any negative scores?: {(df[score_columns] < 0).any().any()}")
```

#### 3. Logic Validation

**Check for logical inconsistencies**:
```python
# Example: If someone is "Very Happy" (Q4), they shouldn't be "Very Anxious" (Q5)
logic_check = df[(df['(4) Score'] > 80) & (df['(5) Score'] > 80)]
if len(logic_check) > 0:
    print(f"Found {len(logic_check)} potentially inconsistent responses")
```

### Automated Validation Dashboard

**Complete Validation Script**:
```python
def create_validation_report(df, output_file='validation_report.txt'):
    """
    Generates comprehensive validation report
    """
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write("=== DATA VALIDATION REPORT ===\n\n")
        
        # 1. Data Completeness
        f.write("1. DATA COMPLETENESS\n")
        total_cells = df.shape[0] * df.shape[1]
        missing_cells = df.isnull().sum().sum()
        completeness = (1 - missing_cells/total_cells) * 100
        f.write(f"   - Total completeness: {completeness:.1f}%\n")
        f.write(f"   - Missing values: {missing_cells}\n\n")
        
        # 2. Response Distribution
        f.write("2. RESPONSE DISTRIBUTION\n")
        for col in df.columns:
            if 'Score' in col:
                f.write(f"   {col}:\n")
                f.write(f"     Mean: {df[col].mean():.1f}%\n")
                f.write(f"     Std Dev: {df[col].std():.1f}%\n")
                f.write(f"     Missing: {df[col].isnull().sum()}\n")
        
        # 3. Ward Distribution
        f.write("\n3. WARD DISTRIBUTION\n")
        ward_counts = df['ward'].value_counts()
        for ward, count in ward_counts.items():
            f.write(f"   Ward {ward}: {count} responses ({count/len(df)*100:.1f}%)\n")
        
        # 4. Calculation Verification
        f.write("\n4. CALCULATION CHECKS\n")
        # Verify domain calculations
        domains = {
            'Life Satisfaction': ['(1) Score', '(2) Score', '(3) Score', '(4) Score', '(5) Score'],
            'Health': ['(11) Score', '(12) Score', '(13) Score', '(14) Score']
        }
        
        for domain, cols in domains.items():
            manual_calc = df[cols].mean(axis=1).mean()
            f.write(f"   {domain}: {manual_calc:.1f}%\n")
    
    print(f"Validation report saved to {output_file}")
```

### Red Flags to Watch For

1. **Impossible Values**
   - Scores > 100% or < 0%
   - Age < 18 in adult survey
   - Contradictory responses

2. **Statistical Anomalies**
   - Standard deviation > 40% (indicates high variance)
   - Mean and median differ by > 10% (indicates skewed data)
   - Sample sizes < 30 for subgroup analysis

3. **Pattern Detection**
   ```python
   # Detect response patterns (e.g., all same answers)
   def detect_suspicious_patterns(df):
       suspicious = []
       for idx, row in df.iterrows():
           scores = row[row.index.str.contains('Score')]
           if scores.nunique() == 1:  # All answers are the same
               suspicious.append(idx)
       return suspicious
   ```

### Validation Workflow Summary

1. **Run Automated Checks** (5 minutes)
   - Execute validation script
   - Review red flags

2. **AI Cross-Verification** (10 minutes)
   - Use different AI to verify key metrics
   - Check sentiment analysis samples

3. **Manual Spot Checks** (15 minutes)
   - Review 5-10% sample
   - Verify extreme cases
   - Check logic consistency

4. **Document Results**
   ```python
   validation_summary = {
       'date': datetime.now(),
       'total_records': len(df),
       'completeness': completeness,
       'anomalies_found': len(anomalies),
       'manual_checks_passed': True,
       'ai_verification': 'Confirmed',
       'notes': 'All calculations verified'
   }
   ```

### Quick Validation Checklist

- [ ] All scores between 0-100%?
- [ ] Sample sizes adequate (n>30)?
- [ ] Missing data handled consistently?
- [ ] Calculations verified by second AI?
- [ ] 5% manual sample checked?
- [ ] Outliers investigated?
- [ ] Logic checks passed?
- [ ] Results make intuitive sense?

Remember: It's better to spend 30 minutes validating than to present incorrect results!

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: "My percentages don't add up to 100%"
**Solution**: Check for missing data (NaN values)
```python
# Check missing data
missing_counts = df.isnull().sum()
print(missing_counts[missing_counts > 0])
```

### Problem: "AI gives different results each time"
**Solution**: Use structured prompts with clear output format requirements

### Problem: "Charts look messy"
**Solution**: Limit data points, use clear labels, choose appropriate chart types

## Next Steps

1. **Practice with Sample Data**: Start with a few survey questions
2. **Build Gradually**: Add complexity once basics work
3. **Document Everything**: Keep notes on what works
4. **Ask for Help**: Use AI to explain errors
5. **Share Results**: Create reports for stakeholders

Remember: Data analysis is about telling stories with numbers. Focus on insights that help improve community wellbeing!

## Survey Design for Better AI Analysis

### Why Question Design Matters for AI

The way questions are structured dramatically affects AI's ability to analyze responses. Well-designed questions lead to:
- More accurate sentiment analysis
- Better pattern recognition
- Clearer actionable insights
- Easier comparative analysis

### Key Principles for AI-Friendly Questions

#### 1. Structure Open-Ended Questions

**Poor Design**: "Any comments about tourism?"
- Too vague
- Hard to categorize
- Inconsistent responses

**Better Design**: 
```
"Regarding tourism in your area:
a) One positive impact: ___________
b) One challenge: ___________  
c) One suggestion: ___________"
```

#### 2. Provide Context Anchors

**Without Context**: "Are you happy?"

**With Context**: "Thinking about last month, what made you happiest?"
- Specific timeframe
- Concrete examples
- Easier to analyze patterns

#### 3. Use Progressive Disclosure

Start broad, then get specific:
```
Level 1: "How do you feel about tourism?" [Positive/Neutral/Negative]
Level 2: "Which aspects?" [Economic/Cultural/Environmental]
Level 3: "Please explain:" [Open text]
```

### Optimizing for Sentiment Analysis

**Original Question**: "What makes you happy?" (one word)

**Optimized Version**:
```
"Complete this sentence: I feel happiest when..."
(Provide 2-3 specific examples)
```

**Why This Works Better**:
- Provides context
- Generates richer data
- Easier to identify themes
- Better sentiment extraction

### Example: Improving the Threats Question

**Current**: Multiple choice only

**Enhanced**:
```
"Rank top 3 community threats:
1. _________ 
   Why most serious: _________
   Specific impact observed: _________
   
2. _________
3. _________"
```

This gives AI:
- Priority information
- Reasoning data
- Concrete examples
- Solution opportunities

### Prompt Engineering for Analysis

When analyzing improved questions, use structured prompts:

```python
analysis_prompt = """
Analyze these structured tourism responses:

For each response set:
1. Categorize positive impacts (economic/social/cultural)
2. Severity score for challenges (1-5)
3. Feasibility of suggestions (high/medium/low)
4. Overall sentiment (-5 to +5)
5. Stakeholder type (resident/business/youth/elder)

Output format:
- Summary statistics
- Key themes with examples
- Actionable recommendations ranked by feasibility
"""
```
