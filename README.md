## About

This dashboard visualizes the 2025 Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality (KPLRM) Community Wellbeing Survey results, providing insights into:
- 12 wellbeing domains
- Ward-by-ward analysis

The dashboard helps community leaders and stakeholders understand the current state of wellbeing across different aspects of life in the Khumbu region.
