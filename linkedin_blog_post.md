# Building a Community Wellbeing Dashboard: My Journey with One Nature

*A reflection on my two-month internship creating data-driven insights for sustainable tourism in Nepal*

---

## The Challenge: From Raw Data to Actionable Insights

Two months ago, I embarked on an exciting journey with One Nature to tackle a meaningful challenge: transforming raw survey data from Nepal's Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality into a comprehensive wellbeing dashboard. The goal? To help guide sustainable tourism development by putting community wellbeing at the heart of decision-making.

Starting with a CSV file containing hundreds of survey responses across 77 questions, my task was to build a dashboard from scratch that would make this data accessible, understandable, and actionable for stakeholders.

## The Process: Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization

### Starting from Zero
The journey began with understanding the data structure - survey responses measuring nine domains of wellbeing including life satisfaction, health, community vitality, tourism impact, and environmental quality. Each response needed to be cleaned, standardized, and validated before any meaningful analysis could begin.

### Key Technical Achievements:
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardized scoring systems across different question types, handled missing data, and validated response consistency
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculated domain scores, identified trends across demographics, and discovered critical insights like the "tourism paradox" - where 98% support tourism growth despite cultural concerns
- **Dashboard Development**: Created an interactive HTML dashboard with multiple panels showing demographics, domain scores, ward comparisons, and sentiment analysis of open-ended responses
- **AI Integration**: Leveraged Claude Code and ChatGPT for sentiment analysis of Nepali and English text responses, extracting themes from community feedback

## Using Notion as My Project Management Hub

Throughout this internship, Notion became my digital workspace for organizing this complex project. Here's how I structured my workflow:

### Project Database
- Created a master database tracking all Python scripts, analysis files, and iterations
- Tagged each entry by analysis type (demographics, tourism, economy, etc.)
- Linked related analyses to see connections between different data insights

### Daily Progress Logs
- Maintained daily entries documenting:
  - Tasks completed
  - Challenges encountered
  - Solutions implemented
  - Questions for mentors
- This created a searchable knowledge base I could reference when similar issues arose

### Task Management
- Used Kanban boards to move tasks through stages: "To Analyze" → "In Progress" → "Validation" → "Complete"
- Set up automated reminders for data validation checks
- Created templates for recurring analysis workflows

### Documentation Wiki
- Built a comprehensive wiki including:
  - Data dictionary explaining all 77 survey questions
  - Methodology notes for each calculation
  - Code snippets for common operations
  - Meeting notes with mentor feedback

This systematic approach in Notion allowed me to manage the complexity of building a dashboard from scratch while maintaining clear documentation for future researchers.

## Key Insights Discovered

Through careful analysis, several critical findings emerged:

1. **The Tourism Paradox**: While 98% of residents want more tourists, there's significant concern about cultural preservation and environmental impact
2. **Economic Challenges**: 70% of residents experience financial stress, making tourism's economic benefits crucial despite cultural trade-offs
3. **Ward Disparities**: Significant differences in wellbeing scores across the five wards, requiring targeted interventions
4. **Youth Outmigration**: Identified as a top threat to community wellbeing, linked to limited local opportunities

## Gratitude to My Mentors and Collaborators

This journey wouldn't have been possible without the incredible support from the One Nature team and our client:

**Beatrice** - Thank you for your exceptional coordination throughout this project. Your ability to organize meetings, summarize complex discussions, and ensure clear communication of key deliverables kept the project on track. Your project management skills made this complex undertaking manageable.

**Beth** - Your dual role as both technical advisor and cultural interpreter was invaluable. Thank you for your patient guidance on dashboard design while helping me understand the human stories within the numbers. Your insights about community dynamics truly brought the data to life and pushed me to think beyond just presenting data to creating actionable insights.

**Paul (Client)** - Your deep knowledge of the Khumbu region and its communities provided the critical context that transformed raw data into meaningful insights. Thank you for sharing your on-the-ground expertise and helping identify which findings would be most valuable for sustainable tourism planning.

**John** - Thank you for your supportive presence throughout the project and for sharing Ryan's valuable insights about the Most Significant Change (MSC) methodology. While we couldn't implement MSC in the current dashboard due to data limitations, this "forensic" evaluation approach offers exciting possibilities for future iterations. For those interested, I've documented how to reformat survey questions and create MSC-based visualizations in the accompanying technical guides (see [MSC Implementation Guide](msc_implementation_guide.md) and [MSC Sentiment Tracker Design](msc_sentiment_tracker_design.md)).

**Ryan** - Thank you for introducing the MSC methodology - your contribution sparked important discussions about how to capture change attribution and create early warning systems without baseline data. This approach aligns perfectly with our sentiment analysis work and opens new avenues for community-driven evaluation.

## Skills Developed

This internship provided hands-on experience with:
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for data analysis
- AI tools for natural language processing
- Dashboard design and user experience
- Cross-cultural data interpretation
- Project management and documentation

## Looking Forward

This experience reinforced my passion for using data science to drive positive social impact. The dashboard we created isn't just a technical achievement - it's a tool that will help ensure tourism development in Nepal truly benefits local communities.

To my fellow data enthusiasts: remember that behind every dataset are real people and communities. Our role is not just to analyze numbers, but to amplify voices and enable better decisions for sustainable development.
